# Game Development
I used Unity and C# to develop this game. I have used Clip Studio to create models for my 2D drinking game. I used the pictures of Jack Daniels, Old Monk Rum, and Toki bottles that I took with my phone camera. Then I edited the images using the software and removed the backgrounds to use them in the game. I also added animations to the splash on top of the bottles. I imported audio and fonts for the game. The rest of the game, including scripts and models, was created by me from scratch.
